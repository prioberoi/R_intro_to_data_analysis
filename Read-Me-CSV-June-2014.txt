National Broadband Map Data

Note: If you have any questions about this data please e-mail sbdd@ntia.doc.gov. 


This folders contain broadband availability data submitted to the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (NTIA) on October 1, 2014 from State Broadband Initiative grantees in every state, Territory and the District of Columbia. This data is current as of June 30, 2014. For more information regarding the Grantees please visit http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/SBDD 

The following files are included for each grantee: 
	StateAbbreviation-NBM-CBLOCK-CSV-June-2014.zip --- Broadband Availability data for Census Blocks less than 2 square miles
	StateAbbreviation-NBM-Wireless-CSV-June-2014.zip --- Broadband Availability data for Wireless
	StateAbbreviation-NBM-Address-Street-CSV-June-2014.zip --- Broadband Availability data for Large Blocks 
 	StateAbbreviation-NBM-CAI-CSV-June-2014.zip --- Broadband Availability at Community Anchor Institutions    
	StateAbbreviation_Methodology_YYYY_MM_DD.pdf --- Methodological description of grantee data collection process
	StateAbbreviation_DataPackage_YYYY_MM_DD.xls --- This is the List of providers that the grantee reached out to for inclusion
	
Note: Because data was originally submitted in a file geodatabase and converted to CSV for download, this data may look slightly different in this format than how it is displayed on BroadbandMap.gov. The HOCONUM and HOCONAME field values, were added during the data integration process and are a holding company roll-up based on the FCC Registration Numbers (FRNs). This allows you to identify unique providers across the country. For a complete description of how the data was collected, please refer the NOFA, Technical Appendix, and NOFA clarification, which can be found here: http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/notices#mapping . 

When citing data, it should read, "US Dept of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, State Broadband Initiative (CSV format June 30, 2014)."

###########Census Blocks with an area less than 2 square miles###########
NOTES: The following are column headings for the csv file named StateAbbreviation-NBM-CBLOCK-CSV-June-2014.zip. Each row is one record per provider technology, advertised speed, per census block less than 2 square miles. This includes data that was submitted at address level in census blocks less than 2 square miles, and speed data that was submitted in the address, roadsegment, block, or overview feature class by MSA or County. Address data has been aggregated to census block data, and was not provided in this dataset.

Readme Additions

The files for Random Point (e.g. suffix -NBM-Address-Street-CSV-) are the result of the post processing result described here - http://www.broadbandmap.gov/about/technical-overview/post-processing-data.  This process is primarily established in order to provide statistics on housing units and population in large census blocks (e.g. greater than 2 square miles).  The download files need to meet the demand of this primary goal (calculating availability statistics) while  a) keeping data deemed by the NTIA as confidential in its Notice of Funding Availability and b) providing the most valid, transparent, and open data as possible.  

As a result of the post-processing, there is an effect in data that appears as a duplicate row.  We choose to not filter that data, but provide the full records that we process to the end user.  In performing the above mentioned geospatial analysis, a single address or road segment shown as having availability from the National Broadband Map, buffered by 500 feet, might overlap many of our random point addresses (used as surrogates for calculating housing units and population).  Additionally, close proximity address and road segment availability features might overlap the same features multiple times.  

Rest assured, we perform unique calculations on the 'random_pt_objectid' to calculate housing units and population w/ availability, but we also leave in every overlapping record in this download file for full transparency.  These records might appear to be duplicate rows by some, but indeed they are not, because many availability features can overlap many of the same random point address features used to calculate availability.

When using this files to calculate availability, it is required to perform unique counts on the 'random_point_objectid' field with whatever appropriate availability metric in which you are interested.
